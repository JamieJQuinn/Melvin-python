# Contributors Guide

Thank you for considering contributing to Melvin.py! 

Please feel free to ask us questions and chat with us at any time if you're unsure about anything.

Best way to get in touch is to either just open a GitHub issue (don't be shy!) or to drop me an email (jamiejquinn [at ] jamiejquinn.com).

We follow the [ColPrac guide](https://github.com/SciML/ColPrac) for collaborative practices. New contributors should make sure to read that guide.

## What can I do?

* Tackle an existing issue or comment on a pull request you have an opinion on.

* Try to run Melvin and simulate your favourite fluid dynamics. If you run into any bugs/problems or find it difficult to use or understand, please open an issue!

* Write up an example or tutorial on how to do something useful with Melvin, like how to set up a new physical configuration.

* Improve documentation or comments if you found something hard to use.

* Implement a new feature if you need it to use Melvin.

If you're interested in working on something, let us know by commenting on existing issues or by opening a new issue. This is to make sure no one else is working on the same issue and so we can help and guide you in case there is anything you need to know beforehand.

## What do I need to know before I contribute?

Melvin.py uses the formatting tool [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and the linting tool [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) to ensure consistent, high quality code. Please ensure you run both tools to format your code before submitting a pull request. Either tool will be run again by the continuous integration service. To maintain good quality, all contributions should pass flake8 and black's checks. Some checks have been disabled already but if you believe more should, please get in touch and we can discuss.
